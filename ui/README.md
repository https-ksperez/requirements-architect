# Requirements Review UI

This is a Vite + React + TypeScript UI that builds on LlamaIndex UI components to review and correct extracted results (e.g., user stories, use cases, and related metadata).

Ideally run this with `llamactl` in the parent directory (See [README.md](../README.md)),
but you can also run it standalone with `pnpm run dev` (workflow integrations will not work).
